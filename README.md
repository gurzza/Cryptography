# Cryptography

In the folder <a href="https://github.com/gurzza/Cryptography/tree/main/RSA">RSA</a> you may find full realization RSA without any cryptographical libraries.

Folder <a href="https://github.com/gurzza/Cryptography/tree/main/Old_Ciphers">Old_Ciphers</a> has the collection of old ciphers like shift cipher, Сaesar's cipher (шифр Цезаря) and so on.

In the folder <a href="https://github.com/gurzza/Cryptography/tree/main/CSDS">CSDS</a> you may see simple client-server console application. Server sends encrypted symmetric key (on RSA) to client. After that client can get encrypted files from server (IDEA not mine:).
